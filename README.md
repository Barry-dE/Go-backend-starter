# Go Backend Boilerplate

A production-ready Go backend boilerplate built from the ground up with a modern stack:

Echo
– high performance web framework

Clerk
– authentication and user management

Validator
– request validation

Asynq
– background jobs & task queues

Zerolog
– structured logging

New Relic
– monitoring and observability

Pgx
– PostgreSQL driver and toolkit

Postgres
– relational database

Tern
– database migrations

Koanf
– configuration management

Redis
– caching and queue backing store

Testcontainers
– integration testing with containers

The purpose of this boilerplate is to help me get started with new projects quickly by providing a preconfigured, scalable, and extensible foundation.
